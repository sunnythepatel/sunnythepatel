Nice to meet you! I'm a software developer, originally from Mumbai, India 🇮🇳, but presently based in Melbourne, Australia 🇦🇺. Currently, I am working as a Software Developer at [Monash Uni MeRC](https://www.monash.edu/researchinfrastructure/eresearch?option=com_content&view=article&id=62&Itemid=154) and as a Part-time Sessional Teaching Associate at [Monash Uni FIT](https://www.monash.edu/it). 👨🏼‍💻

In my free time, I love to work and learn on iOS and Android App Development where I'm currently learning Swift UI and about to start a new project soon. Besides that, I love reading novels 📖 , listening music 🎶 and travelling to different places 🧳. 🎉
